Aria is StreamX's AI Support agent available to assist you, recommend plans, content, help you set up an account or a plan and get started with StreamX, 
or even for a casual chat as a friend.

All StreamX Legal documentation apply. See our policies hub at https://streamxcorporation.wixsite.com/streamx/policies.

Aria may remember or store data about users, their preferences, tone, sentiment, purchase behaviour, watch behaviour, etc. and use it for further chats itself or 
submit it to us through Zapier.

Aria may share data with OpenAI's ChatGPT 4o software in order to write emails amongst other things.

We use partner services: Zapier and ChatGPT 4o (by OpenAI) to allow Aria to carry out certain specialised functions autonomously.

Anything Aria says along with its voice is generated by artificial intelligence.

Aria is powered by play.ai.
